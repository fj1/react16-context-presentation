## Intro

This app was created for a presentation on the Context API in React 16.

## Presentation Goals

This presentation will demonstrate how to update data within the component tree. The goal is to use a minimum number of changes, and to update a component that is two levels deep. We will walk through 3 ways of updating data: prop-drilling, React Context API, and Redux.

## Branches & Tag

The tag `base-app` marks the original app layout.

The branches demonstrate different ways to update data within the component tree.
* The `prop-drilling` branch implements prop drilling.
* The `master` branch implements React 16 Context API.
* The `redux` branch implements Redux.

## Serving
